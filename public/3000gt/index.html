<h1><i>1991 Mitsubishi GTO Twin Turbo</i></h1>
<hr>
<p>A 1991 Mitsubishi GTO Twin Turbo (called 3000GT in export markets) converted from Gran Turismo 7 to Assetto Corsa in a variety of specifications. </p>
<p>One of my oldest conversions, learned much from it. That being said, it's outdated by my current quality standards and needs a rework, mostly optimization wise.</p>
<p>Uses physics by baker7498 (<i>@baker7498</i> on Discord). </p>

<h2>Stock</h2>
<p>The car's stock form. 6G72 engine produces 280HP, delivered to all four wheels in a 40:60 F:R split through an open front, viscous center, and limited slip rear differential.</p>
<p>Features active aero - front and rear wings deploy at speed to eliminate aerodynamic lift. This needed a Lua script to work properly since Assetto Corsa by default doesn't let you have wings that rise at a certain speed and lower at a different speed. Also features same-phase rear wheel steering. ECS suspension was also implemented. Extra option C button toggles between <i>Tour</i> and <i>Sport</i> suspension modes, changing damping stiffness.</p>
<p>Goes where you point it, but it's quite heavy and not very nimble. The 5 speed gearbox has very long gears which stifle acceleration speeds when driving around a track. The standard 225 wide 16 inch tyres do not help the experience either - an upgrade to 255 wide 18 inch wheels dramatically improves cornering performance. All in all, very easy to drive, but also very easy to reach its limits.</p>

<h2>Tuned</h2>
<p>Tuned version. Modifications include stiff coliovers in place of the stock ECS suspension. 4WS delete, engine upgrades to approx. 450HP. 6-speed gearbox swap from the facelift model and a custom shorter final drive ratio. 255/35/R18 modern sport tyres on lightweight Rays TE37 wheels. Functional KAZE Aerocraft front lip and 1999 facelift rear wing. D2 big brake kit.</p>
